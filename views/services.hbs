<h3>Types of Web Development services offered by</h3> <a href="/">Waglogy<a><br>
<h5>Front-End and Back-End Web Development</h5>
<br>
Everything that you see on the website is called the front end. Initially the front-end web development is conducted. This step involves finalising the type of fonts, icons, and images based on your brand voice.
<br>
The back-end represents a particular code that is used to connect the website and the server. Back-end web development makes sure that the data flows accurately throughout the website and the transactions are up to the mark. Common programming languages like Java are utilised for completing this process. It is mandatory to have an expert to complete back-end web development as it requires coding and IT knowledge.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Our Web Development Technologies</h4>

The majority of web pages and web apps on the client-side support JavaScript, which is the primary web language. This means that while server-side technologies vary, web technologies are primarily based on JavaScript (.NET, Java, PHP, Ruby, or even server-side JavaScript Node.js).
